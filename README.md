# Game engine Assignments
---
**My role:**
 - In GDW, I have the role of a programmer.
 With this role, I expect to make quality player controller and make the game feel good to play.
 ---
**Week 1 and 2:**
In the first two weeks, I have created a simple unity scene where there are enemies, interactables, and player.
Both the players and enemies can shoot at eachother and the player may move as they wish with jumping and basic obstacles included.
> These weeks, I've learnt how to use an input system that unity has. I've learnt the singleton design pattern and understood it further.
> I've also learnt how we can implement shooting and how simple it is to have animations and make them look seamless.
