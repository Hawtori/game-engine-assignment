# Game engine Assignments
---
**My role:**
 - In GDW, I have the role of a programmer.
 With this role, I expect to make quality player controller and make the game feel good to play.

I used the tutorial's code as reference when making mine. I fell behind during class and was not able to complete it, thus had to look at and use the code provided.
I also used a third party asset to complete the assignment as it was also given to us prior to starting.
